Blender SPA (based on Blender 3.3 LTS)
======================================

Blender is the free and open source 3D creation suite.
It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline-modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing,
motion tracking and video editing.

This is a snapshot (2023-01-04) of the blender version that is used at the `SPA Studios <https://thespastudios.com>`__.

An online user documentation for Blender SPA and its addons, and windows build

It includes the following changes (based on Blender 3.3 LTS):

 - Scene override option in the VSE editor.
 - New grease pencil C++ based drawing operator.
 - New plane 3d gizmo for quick stroke manipulations.
 - Shift & trace functionality.
 - World space onion skinning.
 - Grease pencil undo system.
 - Grease pencil performance improvements.

Note that the SPA studios is not expected to provide support on any of the added features.
